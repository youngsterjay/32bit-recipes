			<br>
			Stir together in a large/medium bowl:
			<br><em>1 1/2 Tablespoons Sesame Oil</em>
			<br><em>3 Tablespoons Soy Sauce</em>
			<br><em>2 Teaspoons Cornstarch</em>
			<br>
			Cut chicken tenderloins into halves or quarters and mix it into the bowl, coating it well.
			<br>Pop that bowl in the fridge for about 15 minutes.
			<br>
			<br>
			Stir together in a smaller bowl:
			<br><em>1/4 Cup Sesame Oil</em>
			<br><em>1/4 Cup Soy Sauce</em>
			<br><em>1 Tablespoon Honey</em>
			<br>Stir very well, make sure the honey is fully incorporated; otherwise it will burn!
		</p>
		<p class='cardslong' style='font-family:klee;'>
			<span style='font-size:25px;font-family:biscuit'>Instructions- Pan</span>
			<br>
			Cut up your <em>Green Beans</em> and <em>Green Onions</em> if you need to at this point.
			<br>
			<br>
			Put a bit of sesame oil in the pan for cooking and heat it up on medium-low heat before adding the chicken.
			<br>
			Stir chicken frequently and flip it every so often to cook it evenly.
			<br>
			Once the chicken is <em>almost</em> cooked, slowly add the honey sauce we made earlier and mix as you go.
			<br>
			Check if your chicken is fully cooked by trying to cut into it with your spatula and checking the color; make sure it's not pink!
			<br>
			<br>
			Once it's cooked, add green beans and ginger. Stir to coat the green beans fully in sauce.
			<br>
			Once the green beans are a bit soft, but not squishy, add the other ingredients and mix well.
			<br>
			When you feel like your chicken and green beans are soft enough you can lower the heat to a simmer to keep it warm while you serve it over rice!
			<br>
			<br>
			You're all done! This recipe is from <strong>Jay</strong>, who can be found <a href='https://transrats.neocities.org/click/food/stirfry'>here!</a>
